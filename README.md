Disk Performance Monitoring Scripts

FIO and Filebench are standard benchmarks to measure the IO (Sequential Read, Sequential Write, Random Read and Random Write). The values in the config file have been carefully tuned to compare the IO peroformance of Disks vs SSD's. This was used to measure the impact of software overhead on Guest Operating System (Virtual Machines) and Virtual Machines. You can contact me if you are interested in the results.
